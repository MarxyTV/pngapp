## Frames

The images you use for frames must be in `SAVE_DIR/images`.
Can be drag and dropped on application to put them in the folder.
Select a frame to open the image selection menu. 
There is a button to open this folder using your file manager.

Windows: `%APPDATA%\LOVE\pngapp\images`

Linux: `~/.local/share/love/pngapp/images`

## Language Support

**(Need Contributors)**

Currently only has english translations.
If you would like to submit translations, take a look at `languages/en.lua` for required strings. If you do not want to submit a pull request you can submit an issue with the translations and I will add them.

## Talking/Scream threshold

The volume thresholds for talking and scream are adjustable.
You can also set the talk decay. This is how long to wait after talking before resetting to the mouth closed state.

Talk and Scream can be disabled.

## Shake

The shake function picks a random x,y position scaled by the mic volume * shake scale.
The scream shake has a seperate scale multiplyer.

Lerp Speed is the speed at which the image returns back to its origin.
Shake Type is the easing function used to return image to origin.
Shake delay is how soon after triggering a shake jump, another can be triggered.

Shake can be disabled.

## Blink

There are settings to adjust the chance, duration, and after blink delay.

Blink can be disabled.

## Misc

Sleep distance and bounce time can be adjusted. Bounce time is how long it takes to go from point A to point B, so higher = slower.

Sleep can be toggled here.

## Background Color

NOTE: If you would like to avoid chroma key in OBS, set "Allow Transparency" in OBS source settings, and set background color to black in the pngapp settings. This is how I personally use it to stream.

You can adjust the background color to make it easier to see while adjusting options and for chroma key-ing in applications like OBS.

## Moving

You can hold right click to drag the image around and use scroll wheel to zoom in/out.

## Save/Load

You can save your settings, revert to defaults, and revert to last loaded/saved settings.

> Note: Currently UI state is only saved manually with everything else (which tabs are open/closed)

## Server

By default, a tcp server is opened at port `localhost:20501` for listening to remote commands

`echo {"name":"changeSlot","args":{"slot":5}} | curl telnet://localhost:20501`

available commands:

- sleepToggle (ex: `{"name":"sleepToggle"}`)
- changeSlot (ex: `{"name":"changeSlot","args":{"slot":1}}`)
